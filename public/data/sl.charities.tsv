They welcome and nurture hearing impaired children from all ethnic and religious backgrounds. In some cases, the students who attend SJS live at the school campus. They come from low-income families, and for many of them, SJS provides an otherwise non-existent opportunity to learn how to manage their lives as hearing-impaired individuals in a hearing society."

Old age casts a melancholy mist over anyone who reaches a helpless age with no one to help assist or even to say a kind understanding and reassuring word. Our mission is to raise awareness and ensure that people in Sri Lanka understand how much older people contribute to society and that they must enjoy their right to healthcare social services and economic and physical security.

In most cases both the parents of these poor children fell victims to this tragedy and these children are left without any close kith or kin to look after them. Although short term relief measures are underway in a massive scale, in the affected Hambantota District neither the GOSL nor any Not For Profit organisation has so far made any long term plans to set up institutions not only to look after these orphaned children but to provide long term care and other basic needs until they become useful citizens of Sri Lanka. Furthermore, the foundation also plans to construct 50 new houses to families where the children have lost one parent due to this recent disaster. Thus, seeing the future need first, the foundation decided to construct an orphanage for these children whose parents fell victim to the recent tsunami disaster. "
